<p>The programme brings together all the training available to graduate research students in the <b>Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division (MPLS)*</b> including academic courses, research, teaching, professional skills and career development training. With access to all these courses, you and your supervisor are able to tailor a training programme to suit your individual needs and interests.</p>

<p>You can register to attend courses run by your own department, other departments in MPLS, and by the MPLS Division itself. To browse and register for these, click on ‘Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences’ on the tree to your left and the list will expand to show the departments. You can then click on each department to see the list of courses available.</p>
