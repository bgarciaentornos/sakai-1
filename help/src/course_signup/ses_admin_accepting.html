<h2>Accepting, Approving, Rejecting and Managing Waiting Lists for Students on a Module</h2>

<p>If you are a <strong><code>Module Administrator</code></strong> you are able to accept, approve, and reject students who have enrolled on a module in your department. As the Module Administrator you have an overview for all of the modules that you are administering. </p>
<h3>Accepting or Rejecting Students on a Module </h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the Student Enrolment System click <strong><code>Module Signup</code></strong> on the left hand navigation menu, then click on  <strong><code>Pending Acceptances</code></strong> at the top of the page. </li>
  <li>In this screen you will see all the students who have signed up for modules in your department whose status is marked 'pending'.</li>
  <li>On each student record on the far right under the heading Actions there are two options displayed as hyperlinks, <strong><code>Accept</code></strong> or <strong><code>Reject</code></strong>. </li>
  <li>By clicking the relevant link the student will be accepted onto the module and an email will alert their supervisor to approve the student's attendance. By rejecting the student, they will be sent an email informing them that they cacnot attend the course. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Approving a Student on a Module and by-passing the Supervisor Approval Process </h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong><code>Module Administrators</code></strong> are able to approve students, bypassing the process of supervisor's approval. When a student has been <strong><code>Accepted </code></strong>on a module in the <strong><code>Pending Acceptances</code></strong> screen the hyperlinks under Actions change to <strong><code>Approve</code></strong> or <strong><code>Reject</code></strong>. </li>

  <li>By clicking <strong><code>Approve</code></strong> the student will be sent an email informing them that they have been approved and are able to attend the course. </li>
  </ol>

<h3>Managing Students on a Waiting List</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong><code>Module Administrators</code></strong> are able to manage students who wish to attend a course but have been placed on a waiting list due to the course being full. When a student has <strong><code>Joined the Waiting List</code></strong> they will appear under the module in <strong><code>Module Administration</code></strong>. </li>
  <li>If a place becomes available due to a student withdrawing, <strong><code>Module Administrators</code></strong> can change the status of any student on the waiting list to <strong><code>Accepted</code></strong>. This will generate an email to the student informing them they have a place on the module. </li>
</ol>
