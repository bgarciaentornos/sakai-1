<h2>Approving and Rejecting Students on a Module for Supervisors </h2>

<p>If you are a <strong><code>Supervisor</code></strong> you are able to approve and reject the requests from students under your supervision who have enrolled on a module. You will receive an email when any of your students enrol for a module asking you to approve or reject the request. You will need to log into WebLearn using your single sign-on user name and password to complete the process. </p>
<ol>
  <li>When you receive an automated email, click on the link provided in the email which will take you into the SES. </li>

  <li>When a student has been <strong><code>Accepted </code></strong>by the <strong><code>Module Administrator</code></strong> they will appear in the <strong><code>Pending Acceptances</code></strong> screen in the WebLearn interface. Using the hyperlinks under Actions by each student's name you can change it to <strong><code>Approve</code></strong> or <strong><code>Reject</code></strong>. </li>
  <li>By clicking <strong><code>Approve</code></strong> the student will be sent an email informing them that they have been approved and are able to attend the course. By clicking <strong><code>Reject</code></strong> they will be sent an email informing them that they have been rejected and are unable to attend the course.</li>
