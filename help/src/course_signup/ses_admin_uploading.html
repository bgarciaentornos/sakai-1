<h2>Uploading Students onto a Module</h2>
<p><strong><code>Module Administrators</code></strong> may wish to bulk register students onto modules in their department which are compulsory or to ensure that students within their home department are registered before opening the course for wider availability. </p>
<h3>Bulk Signup</h3>
<ol>
  <li>To upload multiple students onto SES, go to <strong><code>Module Signup</code></strong> on the left hand side navigation menu, then click the <strong><code>Module Administration</code></strong> link at the top. </li>
  <li>Use the 'select a module' drop-down and find the module you wish to upload to. </li>
  <li>At the bottom of the screen  on this module is a hyperlink <strong><code>Add Signup</code></strong>.</li>
  <li>Click the link to bring up a pop screen in which you can enter either the students' email addresses or their SSO (Single Sign-On) username. </li>
  <li>Any email addresses added in this field must be an Oxford email address as external emails addresses will not be recognised by the system. In some cases, the student's department email address may not be recognised and a college email addresss should be used instead. </li>
  <li>An error message will alert you when an email address has not been recognised which can be remedied by the action in point 5.</li>
  <li>Click <strong><code>Find</code></strong> which will  take you to a list of users email addresses found on the system.</li>
  <li>Tick the instance of the module you would like to sign the students up for under Select Modules and click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.</li>
  <li>The students will then appear on the module.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Module Administrators</code></strong> can oversubcribe courses should they need to. </li>
  <li>When using the bulk signup facility it is important to <strong><code>Approve</code></strong> students as this method does not involve supervisor approvals. By approving students using the <strong><code>Approve</code></strong> hyperlink this will generate an email to the student indicating that they have been enrolled on the course. </li>
