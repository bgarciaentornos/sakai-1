<h2>Signing Up for a Module</h2>
<p>Once you have found a Module that you would like to attend, please carefully check that you fulfill the eligibility criteria in the module description to make sure the course is suitable for you. Please also ensure that you are able to attend the module on the date and times specified. </p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If the Module is marked <strong><code>Full</code></strong> see 
What to do if a Module is Full.</p>

<ol><li>
  <p>Select the Module Parts you wish attend by clicking the radio button next to the option which suits you &#45; this will be made clear in the Module Description (eg you may be required to sign up 
for both a Laboratory and Lecture series).  In many cases there will be only one module part to select. Click the grey <strong><code>Signup</code></strong> button at the bottom of the course description. </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>A pop up window will ask for your supervisor&#39;s email address and your reasons for wanting to attend the Module. 
This is needed because your supervisor&#39;s permission is required for you to attend any training Modules. To continue, click 'Confirm Signup' or 'Cancel' if you no longer wish to enrol for the course. </p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong>You will need to enter
an email address recognised by the University.  </p></li>

<li><p>Following submission an email will be sent to your <strong><code>Supervisor</code></strong> and the <strong><code>Module Administrator</code></strong> for approval.</p></li>

<li>
  <p>When approval has been granted you will be notified via email that you have a place on the Module. You will also be notified if approval is not granted.</p>
</li></ol>
