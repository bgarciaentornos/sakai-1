<h2>Signing Up for a Module</h2>
<p>Once you have found a Module you wish to attend, carefully check you fulfill the eligibility criteria to make sure the course is suitable for you.   </p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If the Module is marked <strong><code>Full</code></strong> see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ses_modulefull">
Students: What to do if a Module is Full</a>.</p>

<ol><li><p>Select the Module Parts you wish attend &#45; this will be made clear in the Module Description (eg you may be required to sign up 
for both a Laboratory and Lecture series).  Click the <strong><code>Signup</code></strong> button at the bottom of the course description. </p></li>

<li><p>A pop up window will ask for your supervisor&#39;s email address and your reasons for wanting to attend the Module. 
This is needed because your supervisor&#39;s permission is required for you to attend any training Modules.  </p><p><strong>Note:</strong>You will need to enter
an email address recognised by the University.  </p></li>

<li><p>Following submission an email will be sent to your <strong><code>Supervisor</code></strong> and the <strong><code>Module Administrator</code></strong> for approval.</p></li>

<li><p>When approval has been granted you will be notified via email that you have a place on the Module.</p>
<p>You will also be notified if approval is not granted.</p></li></ol>
