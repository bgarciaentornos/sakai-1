<h2>What to do if a Module is Full</h2>
<p>If you find a module you would like to enrol for but it is no longer bookable or there are no places available, then please email the Module Administrator responsible for the course. The Module Administrator's email address is listed in the grey box above the course description. It is at the Module Administrator's discretion whether or not you are subsequently signed up for the course or placed on a waiting list should a place become available. </p>
